# Some Thoughts on Bankruptcy Problems in the Talmud

## 2a

The Mishnah cited on B.T. Bava Metziah 2a contains the following cases where two litigants present their dispute to a court:

1. `A` and `B` both hold a garment. `A` claims he owns the entire garment because he found it first, and `B` claims he owns the entire garment because he found it first. 

2. `A` and `B` both hold a garment. `A` claims he owns the entire garment, and `B` claims he owns half of the garment.

3. `A` and `B` are both riding an animal, or `A` is riding the animal and `B` is leading the animal. `A` claims he owns the entire animal, and `B` claims he owns the entire animal.

All of the above cases have two features in common:

1. Contradictory ownership *claims* are made on the same object.

2. Various methods of *substantiating* these ownership claims can be marshalled. In the first two cases, each claim is substantiated by the claimant's grasp on the garment. In the third case, each claim is substantiated by the claimant's symbolic grasp of the animal in disupte.

In the first case, the Mishnah rules that the court must carry out the following algorithm: 

1. Each person takes an oath that he does not own less than half of the garment. 
2. Each person is given half the value of the garment.

In this case, there is *perfect symmetry* between the two claimants: their claims are equal, and their grasps on the garment are equal. 

The first case of the Mishnah seems to have been inspired by the story told in *I Kings* 3:16-28 of two women who fought over a baby. In that case, Solomon lied and told the women he would make the baby useless to both mothers by splitting it in half and killing it, in the hopes that the lying woman would admit her lie to prevent the death of the disputed baby. 

In the case of a garment, the Mishnah rules that the court need not make empty threats. Instead, the court can simply sell the garment and split the proceeds between the two claimants. However, it is not immediately clear what role the oath prescribed by the Mishnah plays.

In s.v. "Hayu shnayim rochvin" and s.v. "Bizman shehein modin" Rashi uses the phrase, "This comes to inform us." The fact that Rashi does not use this same phrase in his comments regarding the first two cases of the Mishnah implies that according to Rashi, what the Mishnah teaches in its first two two cases is not at all obvious. In particular, the first case of the Mishnah contains two novel teachings:

1. The garment is only split after each claimant takes an oath.
2. The exact wording of the oath is highly specialized and is based on an *inequality* of not owning less than half of the garment.

In s.v. "Shnayim ochazin", Rashi seeks to clarify the nature of the oaths mentioned in the Mishnah and to prevent us from over-generalizing the ruling of the Mishnah. To bring what is implied by the Mishnah’s first case into focus, Rashi pays careful attention to the wording of the Mishnah. 

For Rashi, the crucial phrase in the Mishnah’s first case is "two are grasping." According to Rashi, this phrase implies that the following two conditions hold:

1. Both claimants are physically holding the garment. 
2. There exists a *symmetry of substantiations* between the two claimants such that their physical grasps on the garment are equal.

In other words, according to Rashi, the theme of the first case of our Mishnah is "symmetry in the context of physical grasping." The proposition "Both claimants are physically holding the garment and there exists a symmetry of substantiations between the two claimants" can be negated either by negating the first conjunct of the proposition, or by negating the second conjunct of the proposition.

Rashi assumes that the Mishnah means to imply that if the *second conjunct* is negated, the law is different. Therefore, Rashi infers from his two observations that if *symmetry is broken* in the context of physical grasping, such that only A holds the garment and B does not hold the garment, then even if B is ready and willing to take an oath that he does not own less than half, we do not allow B to take such an oath. In such a case, A keeps the entire garment.

From Rashi’s perspective, if it were not for the first case of the Mishnah, we might have thought that if A was holding the garment entirely, and B was not holding the garment at all, we would allow B to take an oath to substantiate his claim, and we would grant B half of the garment. 

According to this mistaken understanding, we would limit the principle of "he who extracts from his friend" to cases where an oath is not involved. According to Rashi, the Mishnah comes to tell us that the principle of "he who comes to extract from his friend" is so powerful, that we will not even allow it to be overridden by an oath. Therefore, according to Rashi, the first case of the Mishnah contains three novel teachings, two of which were mentioned above:

1. The garment is only split after each claimant takes an oath.
2. The exact wording of the oath is highly specialized and is based on an inequality of not owning less than half of the garment.
3. An oath by itself is not powerful enough to override the principle of "He who extracts from his friend."

According to Rashi, the first case of the Mishnah tells us *nothing* about a case in which neither claimant has a physical hold on the garment. The first case of the Mishnah only explicitly discusses *symmetry in the context of physical grasping*, and implicitly rules on the case of *asymmetry in the context of physical grasping*. 

A case in which neither claimant physically holds the garment corresponds to the category of *symmetry in the context of no physical grasping*. See Tosafos s.v. "And they split" for discussion of this third case.

We have seen that according to Rashi, if the Mishnah had not taught us otherwise, we would have thought that an oath was more powerful than the principle of "he who extracts from his friend." 

But is it really the case that if the Mishnah had not taught us otherwise, we would have thought that an oath was more powerful than the principle of "he who extracts from his friend?"

After all, the Talmud states unequivocally on Bava Metziah 6a that it is obvious . Why is Rashi telling us a ruling that is obvious that an oath is *not* more powerful than the principle of "he who extracts from his friend!" 

Rashi is compelled to write these words because R. Yochanan (as quoted on Bava Metziah 3a) uses the word "vetokef" (violently grabs), which implies that only one claimant holds the garment. We will expand further on this observation in our notes to 3a.

Now that we have a clear understanding of the Mishnah’s first case as cited in Bava Metziah 2a, let us consider the Mishnah’s second case. Whereas the implication associated with the Mishnah’s first case (according to Rashi) relates to a breaking of symmetry with respect to the physical holding of the garment, the second case of the Mishnah involves a *breaking of symmetry with respect only to the two claims*.

In the Mishnah's secomd case, A claims he owns the entire garment, and B claims he owns just half of the garment - thereby introducing an asymmetry into the claims. In this case, the Mishnah rules that after the relevant oaths are taken, A receives ¾ of the garment and B receives ¼ of the garment. It is not immediately obvious how the Mishnah arrives at these numbers. 

Rashi explains that the ruling of the second case of the Mishnah is based on the following algorithm:

1. Calculate how much each claimant concedes to the other claimant. 
2. Grant the conceded amounts to each claimant. 
3. Split the remaining disputed portion equally.

In the second case of the Mishnah, the court first calculates that by only claiming ½ of the garment, B concedes half of the garment to A. This half of the garment is then granted to A and removed from the proceedings. Since A and B now only argue over the remaining half of the garment, the court splits the remaining half into two quarters and grant each quarter to each claimant. The final result is that A receives ½ + ¼ which simplifies to ¾, and B receives just ¼ .

At this point, we can ask whether or not Rashi’s explanation of the Mishnah’s second case is obvious. In other words, is there any other logic we could potentially have come up with to explain the Mishnah? Yes, there is. In particular, we could have explained the ruling of the Mishnah’s second case as revolving around the notion that we arrange the allocation such that each claimant incurs a loss equal to the other claimant. We can call this the *principle of equal constrained losses*. 

This approach would proceed by noticing that the first person, asking for the whole garment but ultimately receiving only three-quarters of the garment’s value, loses a total of one-quarter of his original claim. Likewise, the second person loses one-quarter of his original claim, since he initially asked for one half of the garment’s value and received only one quarter of the garment’s value. 

In other words, the Mishnah’s ruling can be interpreted as ensuring that both parties suffer identical losses. In his *Laws of Appraisals and Devoted Property* 8:4, Maimonidies seems to have understood the Mishnah in just this way, unlike Rashi.

According to Rashi, the first case of the Mishnah is just a *special case* of the second case of the Mishnah. In particular, in the Mishnah's first case, it happens to be that neither claimant concedes anything to the other claimant in the first step of the algorithm. Rashi emphasizes this fact by writing in s.v. "And this one says half is mine" that the second case proceeds "like the law of the first case."

In the Mishnah’s second case, Rashi does not feel the need to anticipate a question as to why this case needs to be taught at all. In other words, it is clear to Rashi that the second case of the Mishnah is *not obvious*. The novelty of the Mishnah’s second case cannot be with respect to the fact that an oath is imposed, since this is already known from the first case. The novelty must instead be with respect to the exact way in which the garment is split. How would we have ruled otherwise without the Mishnah’s second ruling? 

Aristotle is quoted in the *Nichomachean Ethics* as follows:

"This, then, is what the just: the proportional; the unjust is what violates the proportion.... justice which distributes common possessions is always in accordance with the kind of proportion mentioned above;... and the injustice opposed to this kind of justice is that which violates the proportion."

In the case of a proportional division, the amount each claimant receives from the estate is proportional to *how large his claim is relative to the other claimants*. 

Aristotle’s algorithm is as follows: 

1. Compute the sum of all the claims.
2. Compute what fraction of the sum corresponds to each claim.
3. Allocate the fraction of the disrupted amount computed in step 2 to each claimant.

For example, suppose the garment is worth 100. `A` claims he owns the entire garment, and `B` claims he owns half of the garment. The sum of the claims is 100 + 50 = 150. A’s claim corresponds to 100/150 = ⅔ = 0.67 of this total, and B’s claim corresponds to 50/150 = ⅓ = 0.33 of this total. Therefore, A is given 100 * 0.67 = 67 of the value of the garment, and B is given 100 * 0.33 = 33 of the value of the garment according to Aristotle. 

That is, according to Aristotle, ⅓ of the garment is allocated to the one who claims half of the garment, and ⅔ of the garment to the one who claims the entire garment.

If we only had the first case of the Mishnah and a case similar the Mishnah’s second case came before a court, the court would have ruled that the one claiming half of the garment takes an oath that he does not own less than ⅓ of the garment, and the one claiming the entire garment takes an oath that he does not own less than ⅔ of the garment. 

The Mishnah’s second case teaches us that this was not the intent of the Mishnah’s first case. It is only from the Mishnah’s second case that we see the Mishnah rules *differently* than Aristotle. 

Eventually, we will need to consider exactly why our Mishnah feels compelled to argue with Aristotle’s ruling (as pointed out by Michel Balinski in his article "What is Just"). We find a similar divergence from the ruling of Aristotle in the Mishnah cited on Kesubos 93a, which accords with the opinion of R. Nasan.

According to Rashi, we can ask why the Mishnah on 2a does not rule in accordance with Aristotle's propotional division rule.
It is likely that the Mishnah prefers its own allocation rule over Aristotle's due to the desirable properties it exhibits:

1. Self-duality - the allocation rule yields the same result whether we view the problem as one of dividing "what is available" or of dividing "what is missing,".
2. Irrelevance of excess claims - any claims larger than the disputed good are cut down to the size of the good before the allocation rule is applied.

In his paper "New Characterizations of Old Bankruptcy Rules," Dagan proved that the Mishnah’s concede-and-divide rule is the *only rule* which satisfies the two properties of self-duality and irrelevance of excess claims. 

Therefore, it is likely that the Mishnah favored its own rule over Aristotle's because it satisfies these two desirable properties, whereas Aristotle’s proportional rule does not. For other reasons why the Mishnah may have favored its rule over proportional rule, see *How to Divide When there Isn’t Enough* by William Thompson.

According to Maimonies that the Mishnah deploys a constraiend equal losses rule, it is less obvious why this rule would have been prescribed over Aristotle's proportional allocation rule.

Now that we understand the Mishnah on 2a according to Rashi, let’s consider the Talmud’s discussion of the Mishnah. 

The Talmud asks that the language of "I found it and it is all mine" is redundant. On the bottom of 2a, the Talmud concludes that the first case of the Mishanh actually corresponds to two sub-cases:

1. Each person claims he picked up a lost garment first and he therefore owns the entire garment.
2. Each person claims he bought a garment from the same merchant and he therefore owns the entire garment. 

The Talmud explains on 2b that we cannot just ask the merchant what happened because all he knows is that he sold the garment with consent to one person and without consent to the other person, but he cannot remember which person filled which role.

In s.v. "In transactions," Rashi makes a similar move to the one he made in s.v. "Two are holding the garment." 

Rashi does not want us to over-generalize the ruling of the Mishnah. In particular, the Mishnah implies that the only reason the garment is split in the case of a transaction is that it is possible that there exists a symmetry with respect to both claimants telling the truth. 

This implies that if there is an asymmetry, and we are certain that one party is lying, such as if each claims that he created the garment himself on a loom, then the garment is not split, but instead is set aside indefinitely. Whereas Rashi’s comments in s.v. "Two are holding the garment" shed light on when an *oath* is applied, his comments in s.v. In transactions” shed light on when a *split* is applied.

## 2b

After explaining why two sub-cases are needed in the first part of the Mishnah dealing with both lost objects and transactions, the Talmud seeks to reconcile the Mishnah cited on 2a with various Tannaitic authorities, the first of which is Ben Nanas.

the Talmud references a Mishnah cited on Shavuous 45a containing an opinion that seems not to accord with the Mishnah on 2a. 

The case there is as follows:

`A` says to `B`: "Give my son two se’ah of wheat." Alternativel, `A` says to `B`: "Give my laborers one sela in small coins." Later, `B` says: "I gave it to them." However, they say: "We did not receive it!" In such a case, where `A` admits that he gave those instructions and it is also recorded in the `B`’s ledger, then B takes an oath that he gave the son the wheat or paid the laborers, and he receives full compensation from A. The laborers take an oath that they were not paid and receive their full wages from `A`.

Ben Nanas argues that no oath should be taken, since this could easily lead to a false oath taken by one of the parties. The Talmud asks that the Mishnah on Bava Metziah 2a seems to not be in accordance with Ben Nanas, since it is possible that one of the two parties will end up taking a false oath. 

The Talmud answers that ben Nanas might limit his ruling to cases where there is no reasonable story that can conform to both oaths. In our case, both parties may have picked up the garment at the same time, and therefore each oath may in fact be true.

Next, the Talmud references a Mishnah cited on Bava Kama 46a which reflects the opinion of Sumchus that seems not to accord with the Mishnah on 2a. The Mishnah cited by the Talmud contains two cases:

1. It is known with certainty that a previously tame ox belonging to `A` killed a cow belonging to `B`. Therefore, `A` must pay half the value of `B`’s cow.
 
However, the child of `B`’s cow is found dead at the crime scene, and it is not known if it was born dead before the goring occurred, or if it was included in the goring and died as a result of it. In this case, Sumchus rules that `A` must pay half the value of the cow, and one quarter the value of its child (half of a half).
2. It is known with certainty that a cow belonging to `A` killed an ox belonging `B`. In general, when an innocuous animal such as a cow kills another animal, there is an upper limit on how much A will be forced to pay. This upper limit is equal to half the value of `A`’s cow. Therefore, `A` must pay half the value of `B`’s ox up to half the value of his cow.
 
However, the child of `B`’s ox is found dead at the crime scene, and it is not known if it was born dead before the goring occurred, or if it was included in the goring and died as a result of it. In this case, Sumchus rules that one quarter the value of the child is included in the upper limit imposed on what `A` must pay to `B`.

Whereas Sumchus rules in the above two cases that the money in question is split without an oath, the Rabbis rule instead that `A` keeps all of the money in question due to the principle of "he who extracts from his friend."

We learn from Bava Metziah 100a that the crux of the argument between Sumchus and the Rabbis revolves around whether or not the principle of "he who extracts from his friend" should be applied in a case where a presumptive ownership status exists to support `A`’s claim. According to the Rabbis, although we do not know whether the fetus was born before or after the goring, we do know that A originally owned the fetus. This presumptive ownership status is sufficient for them to invoke the principle of "he who extracts from his friend." On the other hand, Sumchus holds that such a presumptive status is insufficient to invoke the principle of "he who extracts from his friend."

Before explicitly spelling out the reason why it thinks the Mishnah on 2a cannot accord with the opinion of Sumchus, the Talmud pauses to consider that the Mishnah which rules that the garment is split (with an oath) does not seem to accord with the opinion of the Rabbis either, since they rule that the value of the dead fetus is given to `A` entirely and no split is carried out. The fact that the Talmud in this question equates the case of the dead fetus with our Mishnah implies that it sees some presumption of ownership on our Mishnah which is analogous to the presumption of ownership invoked by the Rabbis in the case of the fetus. Whereas the presumption of ownership in the case of the fetus derives from the fact that we know with certainty that `A` at one time definitely owned the fetus, the presumption of ownership which the Talmud currently sees in our Mishnah’s case seems to be tied to the fact that each party has a physical hold on the garment. 

According to Rashi s.v. "They are both holding," The Talmud observes that reconciling our Mishnah with the Rabbis is straightforward since it is incorrect that a physical hold on the garment is associated with a presumption of ownership. In particular, we can see why the Rabbis invoke a presumption of ownership in the case of the dead fetus but not in the case of the garment if we consider the notion of symmetry with respect to substantiations of the claims.

In the case of the dead fetus, `A`’s claim has more *substantiation* than `B`’s claim, since `A` was definitely a prior owner, whereas B was definitely not a prior owner. On the other hand, in the case of the garment, both claims are equally substantiated, since both claimants have an equal hold on the garment. 

This symmetry completely nullifies any potential presumptions of ownership and prevents the Rabbis from applying the principle of “he who extracts from his friend,” since the symmetry implies that neither party is extracting anything from the other party. In other words, the Rabbis only apply the rule of "he who extracts from his friend" when there is an asymmetry in the substantiations. However, when the two substantiations are symmetric, they rule that the disputed amount is split with an oath.

Rashi s.v. "They split it with an oath" points out that at this point, the Talmud understands what role the oath of our Mishnah plays according to the Rabbis. From the perspective of the Rabbis, since the substantiations of each claim are symmetric, we cannot apply the rule of "he who extracts from his friend." However, we also cannot ignore the fact that the grasp of each claimant extends over the entire garment, not just to half of the garment. 

In other words, although we cannot say that either claimant is "extracting money from his friend" (since that would imply some asymmetry in the substantiations), we can make the weaker observation that each claimant is attempting to extract money from a claim that is well substantiated. The compromise of the Rabbis in this case is to require each claimant to take an oath. In other words, when there is an asymmetry in the substantiations, the Rabbis required witnesses to justify any transfer of money. When the substantiations are symmetric, the Rabbis require an oath. This oath is of Rabbinic origin and not Biblically mandated.

Now that the Talmud has explained how the Mishnah can accord with the opinion of the Rabbis who argue with Sumchus, it returns to explain why it thinks the Mishnah cannot accord with the opinion of Sumchus: If Sumchus refuses to apply the principle of "he who extracts from his friend" even in a case where there is an asymmetry in the substantiations and rules that the disputed amount is split without an oath, then in a case where the substantiations are symmetric, he should refuse to apply the principle of "he who extracts from his friend" as well, and rule that the garment is split without an oath.
The Talmud offers two ways of reconciling Sumchus with our Mishnah.

First, the Talmud observes that the claims in the case of the fetus are both weak, since neither party knows what actually took place. In contrast, the claims in our Mishnah regarding the garment are made with absolute certainty. Therefore, it may be that Sumchus only allows a split without an oath when both claims are uncertain, since it is by definition impossible in such a case to require each party to take an oath telling us the truth of what occurred. However, in the case of our Mishnah, each claim is made with certainty, and we can therefore reasonably ask each party to substantiate his claim with an oath to that effect.

Second, the Talmud observes (according to Rashi) that we can distinguish between the two cases even if Sumchus would rule similarly in a case where both claims were certain. In the case of the fetus, Sumchus rules that the value of the fetus is split without an oath since regardless of how the court rules, someone will end up losing money. This point is best summed up with a rhetorical question, "Isn’t it enough that each claimant is definitely losing money in this split? Are you going to go further and impose an unwanted oath on each claimant as well?" 

In other words, the Talmud’s current stance is that Sumchus does not impose an oath in cases where the court should feel pity for both claimants. However, in the case of our Mishnah, the court need not feel such pity, since no prior ownership was ever established and we cannot truly say that either claimant has lost anything (Shita Mekubetzes 2b).

In s.v. "drara demamona", Rashi seems to translate the phrase *drara demamona* as "monetary loss." However, it seems unlikely that Rashi would have translated the phrase drara demamona in this way, given that there is no precedent for the word drara to mean "loss."

It is more likely that Rashi translates *drara demamona* literally as "monetary release." Instead of telling us the literal translation of drara demamona, Rashi simply tells us the intent - regardless of how the court rules, one of the parties will end up losing money (i.e. his money will be released from under his control). Rashi seems to be of the opinion that the word drara is related to the Hebrew *dror* from Leviticus 25:10, which corresponds to a *release* from slavery. The Hebrew *dror* may be an abbreviated form of the longer *sheechrur*. 

The fact that Rashi does not tell us how to translate the word drara should not be surprising, since he also leaves the word untranslated in Nidah 6a s.v. "From one time to another." See Tos. who argue that the word drara stems from the root grara, to drag. Exchanging a dalet with a gimel is common in Aramaic. For example, the Hebrew gar, to dwell, becomes dar in Aramaic.

According to Rashi, the Talmud rejects the proposed distinction within the opinion of Sumchus by making two points (Shita Mekubetzes 2b):

1. In the case of the dead fetus, someone is definitely losing money. Suppose that both claims are certain and it actually makes sense to impose an oath on both parties. Instead of assuming that it would be a pity for us to force each party to take an oath and lose money, we should instead assume that each person wants the court to impose an oath. Such an oath would give each party a better chance of defeating his opponent, since his opponent will hopefully not take a false oath.
2. In the case of the dead fetus, from the perspective of objective truth, the fetus only has one owner in the present, we just happen not to know who that owner is. Therefore, we should not grant the court the ability to split the disputed property without an additional oath.

Despite the above two reasons why it would have been reasonable to impose an oath in the case of the dead fetus, Sumchus still does not impose such an oath. How much more so in our Mishnah, where the above two points do not apply, Sumuchus would certainly reason that no oath should be administered! (Shita Mekubetzes).
 
## 3a

The Talmud concludes that the only way to reconcile the Mishnah with Sumchus is to invoke R. Yochanan who said that the oath mentioned in our Mishnah is a special case, imposed under the intention that we don’t want a person to be able to arbitrarily grab on to his friend’s garment and claim it is his.

Rashi s.v. "And grab" emphasizes that "grab" in this context does not mean that we are afraid B will grab the garment entirely away from A. Instead, it means "hold together with" in a symmetric fashion. This comment sheds light on Rashi’s earlier comment in s.v. "Two are holding a garment" on 2a. If we were to translate "tokef" as "grab completely," in the context of R. Yochanan’s dictum, then it would imply that R. Yochanan understood the oath of our Mishnah applies even in such cases where one person holds the garment entirely by himself. 

In other words, we would have concluded that R. Yochanan holds that the word "ochazin" in our Mishnah is lav davka. Therefore, Rashi emphasizes in both of his comments on 2a and 2b that this reading of R. Yochanan is incorrect.
The fact that Rashi feels the need to emphasize that this potential reading of R. Yochanan is incorrect seems strange for two reasons:
1. Why would R. Yochanan assume that the word "ochazin" in the Mishnah is lav davka?
2. We will see later that a baraisa quoted on 6a states explicitly that if only `A` holds the garment, that `B` cannot take an oath to receive to receive half. The Talmud there even asks that this ruling is *obvious*. If this ruling is obvious, then why would we ever think that R. Yochanan argues with a baraisa whose ruling is obvious?

We can answer the first question by noting that Nachmanidies in his comments on the Mishnah cited on 2a states explicitly that the second case of that Mishnah is lav davka. In particular, instead of taking an oath that he does not own less than ¾ of the garment, that claimant can instead simply take half of the values of the garment and say is not interested in the remaining ¼ of the garment. If the second case of the Mishnah is lav davka, then perhaps the first case of the Mishnah is lav davka as well!

We can answer the second question by paying closer attention to R. Yochanan’s statement. A closer look reveals that R. Yochanan’s statement is in Hebrew, not in Aramaic. R. Yochanan is invariably quoted as speaking in Aramaic elsewhere in the Talmud. In general, Talmudic sources speak in Aramaic, and Tanaitic sources speak in Hebrew. In other words, Rashi is likely of the opinion that R. Yochanan is quoting a baraisa.
Therefore, we could have easily learned that the baraisa quoted by R. Yochanan on 2b argues with the baraisa quoted on 6a, and rules that even if `A` holds the garment by himself, `B` can still take half with an oath (there are other places in the Talmud where what is obvious to one person is not obvious to another). Granted that in any other situation, we would not allow an oath to extract money in this way. However, perhaps in the special case of a garment, the Rabbis made an exception and allowed one not holding at all to extract the garment with an oath.

Rashi excludes this interpretation by emphasizing that the word "tokef" in the context of the Baraisa quoted by R. Yochanan should be understood as synonymous with the word "ochez" of our Mishnah. That different words should be used to refer to the same scenario should not be surprising, since we already find on 6a that the Baraisa uses the alternate word "aduk" as a synonym for "ochez."

The implication of R. Yochana’s statement is that we might have otherwise thought that the oath in the Mishnah has Biblical origins. We will see later that R. Chiya seems to be of this opinion.

At this point, the Talmud concludes that the ruling of the Mishnah’s first case is in accordance with the basic rule of Sumchus that money in doubt should be split. We can now see why Rashi explains the second case of the Mishnah as being based on the principle of concede-and-divide rather than upon equal division of losses: The former accords with the ruling of Sumchus.

Next, the Talmud references a Mishnah cited on Bava Metziah 37a containing an opinion that seems not to accord with our Mishnah. The case there is as follows:

`A` and `B` both deposited money with `C`. A deposited 100 dinars and `B` deposited 200 dinars. Then, `C` forgot which of `A` or `B` deposited the larger sum. Subsequently, both `A` and `B` claimed ownership of the larger sum of 200 dinars. The Rabbis say that each should receive the smaller sum of 100 dinars, and the remaining 100 dinars should be held by the court indefinitely. Rabbi Yosei argues and rules that the entire deposit of 300 dinars is held indefinitely.

According to Rashi s.v. "Of R. Yosei" on 3a, Rabbi Yosei reasons as follows: if we give each of A and B 100 dinars, then whichever claimant is lying has no incentive to ever tell the truth. On the other hand, if we withhold the entire deposit, then there is at least a chance that the liar will admit his guilt so that he can recover his 100 dinars. In such a case, whoever is rightfully owed the 200 dinars will receive it. R. Yosei’s reasoning is similar to that of Solomon’s reasoning in the case of the disputed baby.

Accordingly, the Talmud asks that our Mishnah on 2a seems not to accord with R. Yosei, since we could easily apply R. Yosei’s reasoning and rule that the entire garment is set aside indefinitely in the hopes that whoever is lying will eventually admit his guilt instead of splitting the garment with an oath as our Mishnah rules. Although the Talmud already pointed out on 2b that it is entirely possible that neither party is lying in our Mishnah since they may have picked up the garment at the same time, the Talmud currently assumes that R. Yosei would still rule that the entire garment should be set aside since it is still highly probable that someone in our Mishnah is lying, even though we can’t be certain of that.
The Talmud pauses to consider that we can also ask that our Mishnah does not seem to accord with the opinion of the Rabbis either from 37a, since they should rule that whatever is in doubt is held indefinitely. 

In our Mishnah, they should rule likewise that the entire garment is set aside indefinitely!
The Talmud answers that our Mishnah could accord with the opinion of the Rabbis since perhaps they only rule that the third dinar should be set aside since they know it definitely belongs to one of the parties. However, in our Mishnah, they can rule that the garment is split with an oath since it might belong to both of them.

The Talmud gives a similar answer for R. Yosei: he only rules that the entire amount is set aside since someone is definitely lying. However, in our Mishnah, since it is possible that both claimants are telling the truth, he could agree that the garment is split with an oath.

After reconciling the Mishnah on Bava Metziah 37a with the Mishnah on Shavuos 45a, the Talmud proceeds to introduce R. Chiya’s opinion, who seems to interpret our Mishnah on 2a in a very different manner from what the Talmud has so far considered.

NOTE: the Talmud will eventually conclude on 4a that its current understanding of R. Chiya is incorrect, and R. Chiya in fact used our Mishnah as an analogy to support a different ruling. Therefore, any new understanding of our Mishnah that arises from the assumption that R. Chiya did use our Mishnah as a precedent for his ruling that witnesses on a partial claim can compel an oath should be taken with a grain of salt.

R. Chiya’s position can be explained in three steps:

1. R. Chiya’s starting position is the fact that if `A` claims 100 from `B`, and `B` admits that he owes A 50, then `B` must take an oath to the effect that he does not owe `A` the remaining 50. This oath is of Biblical origins according to Shavuos 39b.
2. Suppose that `A` claims 100 from `B`, and that `B` denies that he owes anything to `A`. Suppose further that subsequent to `B`’s denial, two witnesses testify that `B` owes A 50. Then, `B` must take an oath to the effect that he does not owe `A` the remaining 50. R. Chiya claims that a kal vachomer can be used to prove that this ruling is correct. The Talmud will explain the nature of this kal vachomer soon.
3. R. Chiya claims that our Mishnah supports his second point.
According to Rashi, the fact that R. Chiya sees support for his ruling in our Mishnah implies that he understands the symmetry associated with the first case of our Mishnah on 2a as follows very differently from the way the Talmud has been understanding the implications of that symmetry until now.
For the sake of concreteness, suppose that `A` and `B` are arguing over a garment that is worth 100. A claims he owns the entire garment and `B` claims he owns the entire garment. From the perspective of `A`, he claims the entire garment, yet `B` denies his claim entirely. However, the court can see that `A` is in fact entitled to half of the garment. 

In other words, this is analogous to a case in which `A` claims 100, `B` denies the entire claim, and two witnesses then testify that `B` in fact owes `A` 50. From the perspective of `B`, the very same arguments apply. The fact that the Mishnah rules that both parties must take an oath therefore implies that R. Chiya is correct in his ruling that the standard law of modeh bemiktzas can be extended to include the law of eidim bemiktzas.

From R. Chiya’s analogy, we can already see that he differs from the Talmud’s previous understanding on two points:
1. He understands the oath in our Mishnah is *Biblical* in nature. This is in contrast to R. Yochanan who claimed that the oath in our Mishnah is Rabbinic in nature.
2. He takes for granted that each party owns the half he is holding even before the court issues its ruling. This is in contrast to the previous understanding of the Talmud (according to Rashi) that the court never established ownership for either party before issuing its ruling.
Before explaining the exact nature of the kal vachomer used by R. Chiya, the Talmud explains why R. Chiya needs a kal vachomer in the first place. Rabbah explains that when a debtor is in the presence of a creditor and the debtor admits to only a portion of the creditor’s claim, there is a strong possibility that the debtor is experiencing a certain psychological tension. On the one hand, the debtor does not want to deny the creditor’s claim entirely, since this would be a brazen thing to do. On the other hand, the debtor does not want to admit the entirety of the creditor’s claim, since he probably can’t afford to pay back the entire loan and he is trying to stall for more time. The debtor alleviates this tension by admitting to only part of the creditor’s claim. For this reason, the Torah stipulates that when the debtor admits to a portion of the creditor’s claim, he must take an oath to verify that he does not in fact owe anything more to the creditor.

However, in the case mentioned by R. Chiya, where the debtor denies the entirety of the creditor’s claim, we can no longer apply the reasoning above. According to Rashi, the fact that the debtor denied the entirety of the creditor’s claim before the witnesses contradicted him implies that he is willing to lie with respect to monetary issues, and there is no reason to administer an oath to such a person. We might therefore think that he is also willing to lie when taking an oath. Since R. Chiya’s case cannot be learned directly from the case of modeh bemiktzas, R. Chiya is compelled to learn it on the basis of a kal vachomer instead. The kal vachomer tells us that even though the debtor is willing to lie with respect to monetary issues, we should not assume that he is also willing to lie with respect to an oath.

According to Rashi  s.v. "Why did the Torah say," Rabbah’s question should be interpreted as follows: The Torah specifies that a modeh bemiktzas takes and oath, which implies that a debtor who denies the entire claim does not take an oath. However, we can imagine an alternate reality in which the Torah does not distinguish between a kofer bakol and a modeh bemiktzas, in the sense that they are both exempt from an oath. Why did the Torah not rule in accordance with this alternate reality? 

After all, the modeh bemiktzas could easily have denied the entire claim, and we should therefore treat him as one who is simply returning a lost item to the creditor (one who returns a lost item does not take an oath).

To this question, Rabbah answers that the assumption that the modeh bemiktzas could easily have denied the claim is not true. In general, we do not assume that a debtor is so brazen as to deny the entire claim of the creditor in a case where the debtor does actually owe money to the creditor.

## 3b

According to Rashi, the kal vachomer tells us that lying about monetary matters does not make one invalid to take an oath. This kal vachomer is strange, since either lying about monetary matters does or does not make one invalid to take an oath.  

Chemdas Shlomoh explains that in this case, there are two equally strong competing arguments. On one hand, we can say that the fact that the debtor denied the entire claim before witnesses arrived implies that he is willing to lie about monetary matters, and lying about monetary matters makes one invalid to take an oath. On the other hand, we can say that perhaps the debtor only owes 50, not 100 as is claimed. The only reason the debtor denied the entire claim was to counter the lie of the creditor that he is owed 100.
