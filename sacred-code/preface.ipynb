    "# Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms permeate our daily lives, from basic tasks like following a cooking recipe to sophisticated procedures such as allocating resources in complex economic systems. While the term “algorithm” might evoke images of modern technology, the essential idea—an orderly, repeatable set of instructions—appears in many ancient sources. One of the richest repositories of algorithmic thinking is the corpus of Jewish law and literature, collectively spanning millennia of commentary, exposition, and debate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book explores the surprising but illuminating intersection between the Talmud—an ancient body of Jewish legal discussion—and contemporary computer science, focusing on the notion that many Talmudic rulings or mitzvot (commandments) can be cast as algorithms. By presenting Talmudic texts side by side with executable Python code and mathematical reasoning, we hope to reveal how both domains strive for clarity, correctness, and fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Philosophical\n",
    "Illustrate that “algorithmic” thinking is not confined to the digital age. It has thrived for centuries in the meticulous reasoning of Talmudic sages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical\n",
    "Offer readers concrete, runnable Python code that mirrors the logic found in classic Talmudic disputes, demonstrating how abstract textual rulings can become real-world procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Educational\n",
    "Introduce fundamental principles of mathematics (like sets, functions, and graphs) and computer science (like program design and fair division algorithms) in a “just in time” manner, where they illuminate the Talmudic material.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not aim to simplify the Talmud’s rich and intricate dialogues; indeed, Talmudic texts often resist attempts at neat formalization. Nor do we intend to force Jewish legal thought into the structures of modern coding. Rather, our intent is to open a conversation—one that extends across time and culture—about how humans create and communicate rigorous processes.\n"
