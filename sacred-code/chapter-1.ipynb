    "\n",
    "An *algorithm* is a step-by-step set of instructions that — when executed exactly — transforms an initial state into a final state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although algorithms are built from *very simple* ingredients, these building blocks can be comnbined and nested to create arbitrarily complex structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In their book *Algorithmic Mathematics* Soicher & Vivaldi explain that the general form of an algorithm is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm** ⟨_algorithm name_⟩  \n",
    "**INPUT:** ⟨_input specification_⟩  \n",
    "**OUTPUT:** ⟨_output specification_⟩  \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⟨_statement_⟩;  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⟨_statement_⟩;  \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⋮  \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⟨_statement_⟩;  \n",
    "\n",
    "**end;**  \n",
    "\n",
    "(A quantity in angle brackets defines the type of an object, rather than the object itself.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The heart of an algorithm is its _statement sequence_, which is implemented by a language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of an algorithm two multiply two numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Algorithm** ⟨Multiply Using Addition⟩  \n",
    "**INPUT:** ⟨Two non-negative integers, $a$ and $b$⟩  \n",
    "**OUTPUT:** ⟨The product of $a$ and $b$⟩  \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⟨Initialize result to 0⟩;  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result $\\leftarrow$ 0;  \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⟨Loop $b$ times⟩;  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for $i$ from 1 to $b$ do  \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⟨Add $a$ to result⟩;  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result $\\leftarrow$ result + a;  \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end for;  \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⟨Return the final result⟩;  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return result;  \n",
    "\n",
    "**end;**  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment statement allows the management of data within an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SYNTAX:\n",
    "```\n",
    "⟨variable⟩ ← ⟨expression⟩;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXECUTION:\n",
    "Evaluate the expression and assign its value to the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment statements should not be confused with equations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, x $\\leftarrow$  x + 1; is an assignment statement (read: ‘x becomes x + 1’)\n",
    "which has the effect of increasing the value of x by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, x = x + 1 is an *equation* (which happens to have no solution).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Return Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `return` statement produces an output sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SYNTAX:\n",
    "```\n",
    "return ⟨expression 1⟩, ..., ⟨expression k⟩\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXECUTION:\n",
    "First, expression 1, ..., expression k are evaluated, obtaining values v₁, ..., vₖ, respectively.\n",
    "Then, the sequence (v₁, ..., vₖ) is returned as the output of the algorithm, and the algorithm is terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The if structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A *boolean value* is an element of the set ${TRUE, FALSE}$ (often abbreviated to ${T, F}$).  \n",
    "A boolean (or logical) expression is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *if-structure* makes use of a boolean value to implement decision-making in an algorithmic language.  \n",
    "It is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SYNTAX:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if ⟨boolean expression⟩ then\n",
    "    ⟨statement-sequence 1⟩\n",
    "else\n",
    "    ⟨statement-sequence 2⟩\n",
    "fi;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXECUTION: \n",
    "\n",
    "If the value of the boolean expression is TRUE, the statement-sequence 1\n",
    "is executed, and not statement-sequence 2. If the boolean expression evaluates to FALSE,\n",
    "then statement-sequence 2 is executed, and not statement-sequence 1.\n",
    "The boolean expression that controls the if-structure is called the *if control expression*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **While-loops**\n",
    "\n",
    "A loop is the structure that implements repetition. Loops come in various guises, the most basic of which is the while-loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "while ⟨boolean-expression⟩ do\n",
    "    ⟨statement sequence⟩\n",
    "od;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXECUTION:\n",
    "a. Evaluate the boolean expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. If the boolean expression evaluates to TRUE, then execute the statement sequence,\n",
    "and repeat from step (1). If the boolean expression is FALSE, do not execute the\n",
    "statement sequence but terminate the while-loop and continue the execution of\n",
    "the algorithm after the \"od\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The boolean expression that controls the loop is called the *loop control expression*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithms and Jewish Thought\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of algorithm is *fundamental* on all levels in Judaism - from cosmological narratives to ritual practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Genesis, the world is gradually transformed from a chaotic state into an ordered cosmos over a series of well-defined “days” (steps). Each day functions as a step in God's creation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial and Final States:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: A chaotic, formless state.\n",
    "**Sequence of Instructions**: A series of divine commands issued in a precise order.\n",
    "**Output**: A structured, habitable universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequential Execution of the Creation Algorithm:\n",
    "Day 1: Light is created.  \n",
    "Day 2: The firmament (sky) is established.  \n",
    "Day 3: Dry land and vegetation are formed.  \n",
    "Day 4: Celestial bodies (sun, moon, stars) are created.  \n",
    "Day 5: Living creatures in the water and birds in the sky are formed.  \n",
    "Day 6: Land animals and humankind are created.  \n",
    "Day 7: The process culminates in a day of rest.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "God calling the light \"day\" is analogous to an assignment statement of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "day $\\leftarrow$ light;\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation algorithm suggests that the cosmos is not a product of randomness but of *purposeful design and order*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Return Statement (Final Output):\n",
    "After six days of creation, the final output is the fully formed cosmos.   \n",
    "The seventh day (*Shabbat*) serves as a termination signal that the creation algorithm has halted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If-structures\n",
    "\n",
    "When God says \"and it was good,\" the implication is that if it was not good, the algorithm would not proceed. This logically equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if ⟨previous creation step was good⟩ then\n",
    "    proceed to the next creation step\n",
    "else\n",
    "    ⟨repeat the previous creation step until it is good⟩\n",
    "fi;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `else` clause is executed when God regrets making man and brings a catastrophic flood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the expression in the above `else` clause has an implicit while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mitzvoth\n",
    "\n",
    "Jewish ritual practice, particularly the sacrificial services performed in the Temple, offers another illustration of algorithmic thinking. The Torah provides detailed instructions regarding every aspect of these rituals:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step-by-Step Procedures: The rituals specify exact measurements, timing, and sequences of actions. For example, the preparation of the sacrificial animal, the way it is slaughtered, the specific incantations recited by the priest, and the precise manner in which the offerings are presented.\n",
    "Guaranteed Outcomes: If every step is followed exactly, the ritual achieves its intended purpose—restoring a sacred relationship between the community and God, atoning for sin, or expressing gratitude.\n",
    "Deterministic Process: Just like a computer program, where an error in following instructions can lead to an incorrect output, any deviation in the sacrificial process could invalidate the ritual or alter its intended spiritual effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "This meticulous approach reflects a broader ethos in Judaism: the belief that the sacred can be engaged with in a precise and methodical way. The rituals are not arbitrary; they are systematic, designed to ensure that human actions align perfectly with divine will.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mankind’s Share in Algorithmic Power\n",
    "\n",
    "In his paper \"Social Software\", Rohit Parikh calls procedures which structure social reality *social software*. From this perspecitve, the commandments of the Torah can be considered an elaborate system of social software. But what is the goal of this system?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bereishit Rabbah 44:1, Rav teaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "The commandments were given for no other purpsoe than to refine human beings. For what difference does it make to the Holy One, Blessed be He, whether one slaughters from the throat or from the nape? Rather, the commandments were given for no other reason than to refine human beings.\n",
    "</blockquote> \n",
    "\n",
    "Although Adam could not execute the creation algorithm, Genesis 1:26 tells us:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "And God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, after our likeness. They shall rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the cattle, the whole earth, and all the creeping things that creep on earth.”\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "In its context, this means tha that God granted Adam the power to control the world by planning and executing his own algorithms, thereby sharing in the algorithmic power which God harnessed in creating the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam is portrayed as *a purely algorithmic being* in the sense that *his sole concern is with effectively controlling nature* via algorithmic processes without any associated ethical concerns or constraints. The absence of an ethical dimension made life at this time relatively simple compared to life after the fall. Adam exhibits the ability to create variables which is crucial for algorithmic control when he names the animals in Genesis 2:20:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "And the Human gave names to all the cattle and to the birds of the sky and to all the wild beasts.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before exerting control over the animals via algorithmic processes, Adam must first name that which he will control. This method of problem solving is often called *name and conquer*. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to maintain his state of algorithmic purity, Man had to follow the simplest possible algorithm: one do nothing instruction. After the fall, Man loses his algorithmic mastery over nature as symbolized by the punishments in Genesis 3:15-19. Man’s task transforms from one of conquering the world to one of conquering himself. The need for such self-mastery is made evident when Cain kills his brother Hevel (Genesis 4:8) - without a robust system of interlocking algorithmic procedures, man after the fall quickly goes off the rails.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rise of Pharoah and his magicians represents a hubristic attempt by Man to regain the algorithmic mastery over the world which was lost after the fall. God puts Man in his place once again by afflicting the Egyptians with the ten plagues, which mirror the ten utterances with which the world was created [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "God juxtaposes the downfall of the Egyptians who tried to arrogate for themselves algorithmic mastery of the world with the granting of an algorithm for self-mastery to the Israelites in the wilderness in the form of ten commandments. The creation algorithm with which God fashioned the world in ten steps is thereby transmuted into a new creation algorithm by which man fashions himself into a proper ethical being.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For parallels between the ten utterances of creation and the ten plagues, see *Zohar Vayikrah* ch. 25, vol. III, 11b and [this article](https://www.thetorah.com/article/invoking-creation-in-the-story-of-the-ten-plagues)."
