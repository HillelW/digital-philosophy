    "# Chatper 2 - Algorithms Revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "In his 2012 article \"what is an algorithm, Moshe Vardi observes that even though algorithms has been known and widely used since antiquity, the problem of defining what algorithms are is still open.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *A Short Introduction to the Art of Programming*, the computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra explained that an algorithm is a special kind of *story*:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "\"An *algorithm* is the *description of a pattern of behaviour*, expressed in terms of a well-understood, finite repertoire of named (so-called \"primitive\") actions of which it is assumed a priori that they can be done (i.e. can be caused to happen)...\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of an algorithm, of an executable precept for the establishing of a certain net effect, is very well known from daily life: knitting patterns, directions for use, recipes and musical scores are all algorithms. And if one asks the way to the railway station in an unfamiliar town, one asks essentially for an algorithm, for the description of a pattern of behaviour which, when followed, will lead to the desired goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now contrast the eyewitness account of the potato peeling session:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"fetches the basket from the cellar;\n",
    "fetches the pan from the cupboard;\n",
    "peels the potatoes;\n",
    "returns the basket to the cellar\"\n",
    "\n",
    "with the corresponding algorithm — the set of instructions, say, the housewife might give to a new maid—:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"fetch the basket from the cellar;\n",
    "fetch the pan from the cupboard;\n",
    "peel the potatoes;\n",
    "return the basket to the cellar\" .\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the two, we may well ask what we have gained, for it seems a roundabout way of doing things: describing a pattern of behaviour which, when followed, will evoke the happening, while in the eyewitness account we had an excellent way of describing the happening itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "What have we gained? Well, nothing as long as we restrict ourselves to algorithms that can be given —as in our example— by a concatenation of names of actions, to be done in the given order. Under that restriction an eyewitness account of the actions \"as they take place\" is equally good. But the behaviour of the housewife (or the maid) could be a little bit more complicated: let us suppose that after the pan had been fetched, she puts on an apron if necessary, i.e. when she wears a light-coloured skirt and that on one day she uses the apron while on the other day she doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a rather abstract level —i.e. without explicit mentioning of the apron and the condition under which it is used, a uniform eyewitness account would still do (in some fashion) for both sessions, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"fetches the basket from the cellar;\n",
    "fetches the pan from the cupboard;\n",
    "takes preparation with regard to clothing;\n",
    "peels the potatoes;\n",
    "returns the basket to the cellar\". \n",
    "\n",
    "with the implicit understanding that \"takes preparation with regard to clothing\" covers the empty action when her skirt is not light-coloured and covers putting on an apron when her skirt is light-coloured.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, however, we want to go into more detail and want to mention the apron explicitly, then \"takes preparation with regard to clothing\" has to be replaced in the eyewitness account of the one day's session by\n",
    "\n",
    "\"sees that her skirt is light-coloured and therefore puts on an apron\". \n",
    "\n",
    "and in the other day's session by. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"sees that her skirt is not light-coloured and therefore omits putting on an apron\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "The trouble is, that the eyewitness account cannot contain the single sentence:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\"puts on an apron if her skirt is light-coloured\". \n",
    "\n",
    "for then the audience justly asks \"does she do it or not?\". In other words: in that degree of details we cannot cover the two happenings by the same eyewitness account, for in that degree of detail the two happenings differ!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is here that the potential power of the algorithm becomes apparent, for we can recognize the same pattern of behaviour in the two happenings and by describing that pattern of behaviour we give something that is applicable under both circumstances, light- as well as dark-coloured skirt. This is possible thanks to the fact that what actually happens when a certain pattern of behaviour is followed may be co-determined by the state of affairs which is current when the action begins...\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of an algorithm is a very powerful one, for a single algorithm \"extracts\" what a large number of different happenings may have in common. And it does not do so by ignoring details, on the contrary, a single algorithm covers a whole class of happenings to the very degree of detail in which the corresponding eyewitness accounts would differ from each other. The possible large number of different corresponding happenings is generated by the different ways of sequencing as might be controlled by the conditional, the repetitive (and similar, see later) connectives...\n",
    "\n",
    "We call an algorithm intended to control the behaviour of a machine, a *program*. In other words, we reserve the name program for those algorithms that are intended for mechanical execution.\"\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the introduction to his Torah commentary, Nachmanidies writes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "Moses our teacher, however, wrote this history of all former generations and his own genealogy, history and \n",
    "experiences in the third person. Therefore he says And G-d spoke to Moses, saying to him as if he were speaking\n",
    "about another person. And because this is so, Moses is not mentioned in the Torah until his birth, and even at\n",
    "that time he is mentioned as if someone else was speaking about him...\n",
    "The reason for the Torah being written in this form [namely, the third person] is that it preceded the creation\n",
    "of the world, and, needless to say, it preceded the birth of Moses our teacher. It has been transmitted to us\n",
    "by tradition that it [the Torah] was written with letters of black fire upon a background of white fire. Thus\n",
    "Moses was like a scribe who copies from an ancient book, and therefore he wrote anonymously.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Genesis Rabbah and the Zohar provide a different explanation: the Torah is written in the third person because it is an *algorithm* which God executed and algorithms are written using the imperative mood. \n",
    "\n",
    "Genesis Rabbah 1:1 views the Torah itself as the algorithm which God followed when creating the world:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "The way of the world is that when a flesh-and-blood king builds a palace he does not build it based on his own knowledge, but rather based on the knowledge of an artisan. And the artisan does not build it based on his own knowledge, but rather, he has [plans on] sheets and tablets by which to ascertain how he should build its rooms, how he should build its doors. So too, the Holy One blessed be He looked in the Torah and created the world.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Zohar Terumah (ch. 61, 161b) elaborates upon the above Midrash as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "And when the Holy One Blessed Be He desired to create the world, He looked into the Torah at every single word… It is written in the Torah, “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” [God] looked at this word and created the heavens. It is written in the Torah, “Let there be light.” [God] looked at this word and created light. And so it was for every word in the Torah God looked at the word and created that word. \n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "This interpretation hinges on the closeness of an eyewitness account and an algorithm as noted by Dijkstra. \n",
    "Given the closeness of eyewitness accounts and algorithms, these Midrashim feel justified in reading what appears to be an eyewitness account as an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Dijstra's above cited discussion of the nature of algorithms, he mentions that \"knitting patterns, directions for use, recipes and musical scores are all algorithms.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "In his paper \"Effectiveness,\" Rohit Parikh takes issue with Dijstra's claim that artifacts such as recipes constitue algorithms in the strict sense of the word. Instead Parikh argues that a distinction must be made between precise algorithms which explicitly spell out every single step and *procedures* which only partially specify the expected outcome without explicitly stating how to execute every single step along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parikh writes as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "\"Consider now a recipe for scrambled eggs as an algorithm. It might go: \"Break three eggs in a bowl. Add half a teaspoon salt, and a quarter cup milk, stir thoroughly, ... \"\n",
    "\n",
    "It can't be said that the various actions described are atomic. In the first place, someone who does not know English will not be able to perform them. That means that these instructions are not written in whatever would correspond to 'machine language' for people. Otherwise they would be the same for all humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "But apart from that, each step really consists of a sequence of substeps which are not mentioned, but have to be performed nonetheless.\n",
    "Thus the various steps in our algorithm are not atomic but really look like subroutines. But in what language are these subroutines written? It is not a language that any of us can speak or program in. These steps that turned out not to be atomic are not created by programming but by training. One learns to break eggs by watching other people do it and by trial and error. One is not necessarily aware of the little steps that make up the process of breaking an egg. Riding a bicycle is perhaps an even more extreme example of this. Very few people who ride a bicycle have any idea of just what it is that they are doing in the sense of being conscious of all the little actions that are necessary to preserve stability. If this were not so, the problem of making a robot that can ride a bicycle would be easy, at least in\n",
    "theory, but in fact it is quite hard - the robots keep falling off... \n",
    "\n",
    "When we condition or train animals or people, what we are doing is asking the subject to come up with a program which satisfies some given correctness condition. E.g. \"when the bell rings (P), this lever should be depressed (Q)\". We have no way of controlling what goes on in between. Moreover, apart from stipulating that condition Q is fulfilled at the end, we do not have much control over what things look like otherwise. (All of us can carry out the instruction \"Write 'John Smith'\", but the banking system depends on the fact that only John Smith himself carries it out in a particular way. To be sure, we can also find differences between the way two different computers, or more precisely, printers, carry out this instruction, but the theory in that case ignores the differnces.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus for a procedure that people follow, the correctness conditions that it satisfies, are nearly all that we know about it. Of course, we can break up an algorithm into smaller bits, and impose conditions along the way, but there is a limit to how far one can go- there is no way to completely characterise a 'computation' as one can do with computers. Whereas in the context of computers, we start with detailed knowledge of the program and try to come up with its correctness conditions, so that if we are lucky, we have both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we see that structurally, there is a crucial difference between a computation and an ordinary procedure. **What the latter is, is not a program but a sequence of correctness assertions.**\"\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Parikh's distinction between algorithms and procedures helps us realize that most of the instructions in the Torah are too vague to be considered algorithms. Instead, they should be understood as procedures consisting of a sequence of preconditions and postconditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this perspective, we see that the Mishnah often refines the preconditions and postconditions found in the Torah. The Talmud often further refines the preconditions and postconditions found in the Mishnah and frequently introduces an algorithm to connect the preconditions to the postconditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: The Commandment of Tzitzit\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preconditions**:\n",
    "  - The individual wears a four-cornered garment.\n",
    "  - The individual is obligated by the covenant to fulfill mitzvoth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Postconditions**:\n",
    "  - The garment has tzitzit (fringes) attached to its four corners as a physical reminder of the commandments (Numbers 15:37-41, Deuteronomy 22:12).\n",
    "  - The wearer is reminded to observe all of God’s commandments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Torah commands attaching tzitzit to the corners of a garment but does not provide detailed instructions for *how* to make tzitzit (materials, dimensions, tying procedure, how many corners are assumed).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Refinement of Preconditions and Postconditions in the Mishnah\n",
    "\n",
    "Mishnah Menachot 3:7 refines the Torah's commandment by addressing ambiguities and establishing practical guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Refinement of Preconditions**:\n",
    "  - The mitzvah applies specifically to garments with *four* corners, clarifying the Torah’s general mention of “corners.”\n",
    "  - The garment must be of sufficient size to be classified as *clothing* (e.g., large enough to cover a child who understands mitzvoth).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Refinement of Postconditions**:\n",
    "  - Each corner of the garment must have tzitzit made of at least four threads folded to create eight dangling strands.\n",
    "  - The threads are tied with specific knots and windings to symbolize the commandments and God’s unity.\n",
    "  - The threads for tzitzit must be made from materials similar to the garment, typically *wool* or *linen*.\n",
    "  - Ideally, one thread should be dyed with **techelet** (a specific blue dye derived from the chilazon).\n",
    "  - The tzitzit serve as a visible, tangible reminder to observe the commandments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Refinement by the Talmud\n",
    "\n",
    "The Talmud (Bavli Menachot 38a-41a) builds on the Mishnah by refining its preconditions and postconditions and providing a detailed algorithm for tying tzitzit. This ensures practical observance while resolving ambiguities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Refinement of Preconditions from the Mishnah**:\n",
    "  - **Garment Requirements**: The Talmud clarifies edge cases such as garments with rounded or extra corners, ensuring consistency in obligation.\n",
    "  - **Who Is Obligated**: The Talmud discusses exemptions and obligations, refining the Mishnah by addressing minors, women, and others who may be exempt.\n",
    "  - **Techelet**: The Talmud specifies when techelet is required, how it should be sourced, and what to do if it is unavailable, expanding on the Mishnah’s general requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Refinement of Postconditions from the Mishnah**:\n",
    "  - **Tying Instructions**: The Talmud standardizes the tying process, specifying:\n",
    "    - Use four threads per corner, ensuring they are long enough for tying and dangling.\n",
    "    - Fold the threads to create eight strands and thread them through the garment’s corner.\n",
    "    - Tie a double knot to secure the threads.\n",
    "    - Wrap one thread (preferably techelet) around the others in a specific sequence of 7, 8, 11, and 13 wraps, symbolizing the gematria (numerical value) of God’s name and unity.\n",
    "  - **Thread Length**: Ensures that dangling threads meet minimum length standards for halachic validity.\n",
    "  - **Intent (Kavanah)**: Emphasizes that the mitzvah must be performed with proper intent to fulfill its spiritual purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tzitzit Algorithm**:\n",
    "  1. **Prepare Materials**:\n",
    "     - Gather four threads for each corner, ensuring proper length and techelet if available.\n",
    "  2. **Attach Threads**:\n",
    "     - Fold the threads and pass them through the corner of the garment to create eight strands.\n",
    "     - Secure the threads with a double knot.\n",
    "  3. **Wrap and Knot**:\n",
    "     - Wrap one thread around the others in the sequence of 7, 8, 11, and 13 wraps.\n",
    "     - Tie a double knot after each wrapping sequence.\n",
    "  4. **Verify Completion**:\n",
    "     - Ensure the tzitzit dangle freely and meet the required length.\n",
    "     - Confirm all four corners are properly adorned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input/Output Pairs in the Mishnah\n",
    "Sometimes, the Mishnah provides examples of input/output pairs but does not specify exactly which algorithm it has in mind to obtain an output from a given input. In the next chapter, we'll take a deep dive into coming up with algorithms that connect that inputs mentioned in the Mishnah to their corresponding outputs."
